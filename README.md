## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2. On mobile: just tap the buttons on the right.
3. On desktop: use arrow keys + space.
4. Try to survive as long as possible and climb the high-score leaderboard!

**Note**: Hard drop gives **2 points per cell dropped**, soft drop gives **1 point per cell**.

## Adding Music (Optional)

To enable background music:
1. Place a file named `tetris.mp3` in the same folder as `index.html`.
2. Any classic Tetris tune works great (e.g., Korobeiniki).
3. The music will auto-play when you press the music button.

If no music file is present, the music button will still work (just silent).
